# Spatial Transcriptomics Visualization using Representation Learning

In this laboratory, we will explore how to visualize spatial transcriptomics data using dimensionality reduction techniques and neural network representations.

## Introduction

Spatial transcriptomics is an emerging technology that preserves the spatial locations of cells while measuring their gene expression. This approach provides valuable insights into tissue architecture, cellular interactions, and spatial patterns of gene expression that are lost in dissociated single-cell methods.

In this exercise, we'll visualize spatial transcriptomics data using techniques like UMAP, t-SNE, TriMAP, and PaCMAP. We'll enhance these visualizations by leveraging neural network representations, exploring how the activations of hidden layers can improve our ability to identify distinct tissue regions and cell types.

By the end of this laboratory, you'll understand how representation learning can be applied to spatial transcriptomics data to extract meaningful biological insights about tissue organization.

Does this structure work for you? Each file follows the format of your previous labs while creating a focused laboratory on spatial transcriptomics visualization. I've created separate MDX files for setup, data loading, preprocessing, neural network training, and two specific exercises.
