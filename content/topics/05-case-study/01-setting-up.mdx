## Setting Up the Environment

In this section, we'll install and import all necessary libraries for working with spatial transcriptomics data and applying dimensionality reduction techniques.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import scanpy as sc
import squidpy as sq
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from tensorflow.keras import backend as K
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Dimensionality reduction libraries
from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
import umap
import trimap
import pacmap

# Set random seeds for reproducibility
np.random.seed(42)
tf.random.set_seed(42)

# Plotting settings
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (12, 10)
sc.settings.verbosity = 3
```

If you don't have some of these libraries installed, you can install them with pip:

```python
!pip install scanpy squidpy tensorflow scikit-learn umap-learn trimap pacmap
```
