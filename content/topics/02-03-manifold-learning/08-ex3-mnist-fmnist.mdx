**MNIST and FMNIST visualization**:
- Apply each dimensionality reduction method to the MNIST dataset
- Compare how well each method separates the digit classes
- Use the nearest neighbor metric to quantify the quality of the embeddings
- Use the metrics provided as a script to laboratory for comparison purposes
