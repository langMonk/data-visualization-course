### Part 1: Dataset Exploration

1. Load the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets using scikit-learn or TensorFlow
2. Explore the basic properties of both datasets:
- Number of samples
- Image dimensions
- Class distribution
- Display sample images from each class

### Part 2: Apply Dimensionality Reduction Methods

Implement and apply the following dimensionality reduction methods to both datasets:

1. **t-SNE**
- Apply t-SNE with at least three different perplexity values (e.g., 5, 30, 50)
- Use early exaggeration and sufficient iterations for convergence

2. **UMAP**
- Apply UMAP with at least three different parameter combinations:
- Vary n_neighbors (e.g., 5, 15, 30)
- Vary min_dist (e.g., 0.1, 0.5, 0.8)

3. **TriMAP**
- Apply TriMAP with at least two different parameter settings:
- Vary n_inliers (e.g., 10, 20)
- Vary n_outliers (e.g., 5, 10)

4. **PaCMAP**
- Apply PaCMAP with at least two different parameter combinations:
- Vary n_neighbors (e.g., 10, 30)
- Vary MN_ratio and FP_ratio (e.g., MN_ratio=0.5/0.8, FP_ratio=1.0/2.0)

### Part 3: Visualization and Qualitative Analysis

For each method and parameter setting:

1. Create 2D scatter plots of the reduced datasets
- Color points by their class labels
- Use consistent colormaps across visualizations
- Include a legend identifying each class

2. Visually assess:
- How well classes are separated
- Whether similar classes are positioned near each other
- The presence of any meaningful global structure

3. Create an enhanced visualization for the best performing configuration of each method:
- Replace points with miniature versions of the actual digit/fashion item images
- Limit to a representative subset (e.g., 500-1000 points) for clarity

### Part 4: Quantitative Evaluation

1. Use the Nearest Neighbor Class Fidelity (cf) metric.

2. For each method and parameter setting, calculate:
- The cf metric
- Trustworthiness
- Additional metrics from the provided laboratory script

3. Create comparison tables and visualizations of these metrics

### Part 5: Analysis and Report

Write a comprehensive analysis (500-750 words) that addresses:

1. Which dimensionality reduction method best separates the classes in each dataset?
2. How do the optimal parameters differ between MNIST and Fashion MNIST?
3. Are certain classes consistently easier or harder to separate?
4. How do the quantitative metrics correlate with visual quality?
5. What are the trade-offs between the different methods in terms of:
    - Computational efficiency
    - Class separation
    - Global structure preservation
    - Sensitivity to hyperparameters
