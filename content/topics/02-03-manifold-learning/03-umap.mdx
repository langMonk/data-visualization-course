#### Mathematical Formulation

#### Simplicial Complexes and Fuzzy Topology

UMAP uses concepts from topological data analysis, particularly simplicial complexes and fuzzy topology. The key insight is to model the data manifold using a fuzzy topological structure.

UMAP constructs a weighted $k$-nearest neighbor graph to represent the high-dimensional manifold, with edge weights derived from the distances between points.

#### Local Metric Spaces

For each point $\mathbf{x}_i$, UMAP defines a local metric space with a distance function $d_i$ and a set of neighboring points $\{\mathbf{x}_j\}$ where $j$ is a neighbor of $i$.

The normalized local distance is:

$$\hat{d}(i, j) = \frac{d(i, j) - \rho_i}{\sigma_i}$$

where $\rho_i$ is the distance to the nearest neighbor of $\mathbf{x}_i$, and $\sigma_i$ is a normalization factor chosen based on the effective scale of the local metric space.

#### Fuzzy Set Representation

The fuzzy topological representation in the high-dimensional space is defined by:

$$v_{i, j} = \exp\left(-\frac{d(i, j) - \rho_i}{\sigma_i}\right)$$

And in the low-dimensional space by:

$$w_{i, j} = \left(1 + a \|\mathbf{y}_i - \mathbf{y}_j\|^{2b}\right)^{-1}$$

where $a$ and $b$ are parameters that determine the shape of the curve.

#### Cross-Entropy Optimization

UMAP minimizes the cross-entropy between the high and low-dimensional fuzzy topological representations:

$$C = \sum_{i,j} \left[ v_{i,j} \log\left(\frac{v_{i,j}}{w_{i,j}}\right) + (1 - v_{i,j}) \log\left(\frac{1 - v_{i,j}}{1 - w_{i,j}}\right) \right]$$

This is optimized using stochastic gradient descent with:

$$\frac{\partial C}{\partial \mathbf{y}_i} = 2ab \sum_{j \neq i} \left[ \frac{v_{i,j}}{w_{i,j}} - \frac{1 - v_{i,j}}{1 - w_{i,j}} \right] w_{i,j} \|\mathbf{y}_i - \mathbf{y}_j\|^{2b-2} (\mathbf{y}_i - \mathbf{y}_j)$$

#### Embedding Initialization

UMAP can initialize the low-dimensional embedding using spectral methods or other dimensionality reduction techniques, which can help convergence and improve the global structure preservation.

The Laplacian eigenmap initialization uses the $d$ eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest non-zero eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian matrix:

$$\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{D} - \mathbf{A}$$

where $\mathbf{A}$ is the adjacency matrix of the $k$-nearest neighbor graph and $\mathbf{D}$ is the degree matrix.

### Key Theoretical Differences

#### t-SNE vs. UMAP

- **Mathematical Foundation**: t-SNE uses probabilistic modeling with Gaussian and Student's t-distributions, while UMAP is based on Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology.
- **Loss Function**: t-SNE minimizes Kullback-Leibler divergence, while UMAP uses cross-entropy.
- **Global Structure**: UMAP typically preserves more of the global structure than t-SNE, especially with default parameters.
- **Scalability**: UMAP generally has better computational efficiency and can handle larger datasets more effectively.
