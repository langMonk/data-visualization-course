# Dimensionality Reduction Methods Comparison Task

### Part 1: Generate Roulade Visualizations
1. Use the provided roulade generator functions to create 50-100 different visualizations by varying:
- Spiral density (spiral_density parameter)
- Number of points (spiral_steps parameter)
- Layer distance (width parameter)
- Angle between layers (angle parameter)
- Roll density (roll_density parameter)

2. For each parameter combination:
- Generate a 3D roulade structure
- Project it to 2D using PCA method
- Save the resulting 2D visualization as an image

### Part 2: Embed Visualization Images Using Dimensionality Reduction

Treat each saved image as a high-dimensional data point (where each pixel is a dimension) and reduce them to 2D using three methods:

1. **PCA**
- Implement basic PCA
- No additional hyperparameters required

2. **t-SNE**
- Implement with at least three different perplexity values (e.g., 5, 30, 50)

3. **UMAP**
- Implement with at least three different combinations of n_neighbors and min_dist
- For example: (n_neighbors=5, min_dist=0.1), (n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.5), etc.

### Part 3: Create Meta-Visualizations

For each dimensionality reduction method:
1. Create a 2D scatter plot of the embedded images
2. Replace each point with a miniature of the original visualization image
3. Include clear labels indicating the parameter settings used for each method


### Part 4: Analysis

Write a 300-500 word analysis that addresses:
- Which method best preserves the spiral structure of the original roulade?
- How do different hyperparameter settings affect the results?
- What patterns can you observe in how similar visualizations are grouped?
- How do the quantitative results from the cf metric align with visual assessments?
