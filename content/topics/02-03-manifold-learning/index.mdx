## Manifold Learning

While PCA and Kernel PCA focus on linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction through eigendecomposition, manifold learning algorithms take a different approach. These methods assume that high-dimensional data lies on a smooth, non-linear manifold of lower dimension. The goal is to find a mapping f: ℝᴰ → ℝᵈ (where D >> d) that preserves key properties of the higher-dimensional space.

This module covers several powerful manifold learning techniques:

1. **Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS)**
2. **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**
3. **Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)**
4. **TriMAP and PaCMAP**
