### (*) Optional: 4. Modern PCA Applications (2 points)

Choose ONE of the following advanced tasks:

#### Option A: Robust PCA for Noisy Image Reconstruction

1. Take 10 sample images from MNIST
2. Add random noise and some structured outliers (e.g., salt and pepper noise)
3. Apply both standard PCA and Robust PCA for denoising
4. Compare the results quantitatively (using metrics like PSNR, SSIM) and qualitatively

#### Option B: Incremental PCA for Large Datasets

1. Load the Fashion-MNIST dataset (a more complex alternative to MNIST)
2. Implement a streaming data scenario by processing the dataset in small batches
3. Apply Incremental PCA and compare its performance (both in terms of computation time and accuracy) with standard PCA
4. Visualize how the principal components evolve as more data is processed

#### Option C: PCA in Convolutional Autoencoder

1. Implement a simple convolutional autoencoder for MNIST digit reconstruction
2. Extract the bottleneck layer representations (latent space)
3. Compare these representations with traditional PCA by:
- Visualizing the 2D projections of both
- Measuring reconstruction quality at comparable compression ratios
- Analyzing the feature importance in both approaches

    Important:

    Write a brief analysis (200-500 words) addressing:

    1. What are the key strengths and limitations of the PCA variant you explored?
    2. In what real-world scenarios would this approach be particularly useful?
    3. How does the computational complexity scale with dataset size?
    4. What improvements or modifications would you suggest to the method?
