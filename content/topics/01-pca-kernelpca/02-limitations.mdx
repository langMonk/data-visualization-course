## Limitations of PCA

* PCA is not scale invariant. Check: we need to scale our data first.

* The directions with largest variance are assumed to be of the most interest.

* Only considers orthogonal transformations (rotations) of the original variables.

* PCA is only based on the mean vector and covariance matrix. Some distributions (multivariate normal) are characterized by this, but some are not.

* If the variables are correlated, PCA can achieve dimension reduction. If not, PCA just orders them according to their variances.
