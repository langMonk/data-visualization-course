# Exercise 2: Univariate Analysis

## Objective
Learn to visualize and analyze single attributes to understand their distributions and characteristics.

## Background
Univariate analysis is the simplest form of data analysis where we focus on examining one data attribute or variable at a time. This helps us understand the distribution, central tendency, spread, and potential outliers in individual features before exploring relationships between variables.

## Tasks

### 1. Visualizing Numeric Data with Histograms

One of the quickest and most effective ways to visualize numeric data distributions is to use histograms.

- Generate histograms for all numeric attributes in the wine dataset
- Experiment with different bin sizes to see how they affect the visualization
- Note any interesting patterns, skewness, or multi-modal distributions

### 2. Continuous Numeric Attribute in 1-D

Choose one continuous attribute (e.g., alcohol content, pH) and create more detailed visualizations:

- Plot it in continuous space using a kernel density estimation (KDE) plot
- Create a side-by-side comparison of a histogram and KDE plot for the same attribute
- Analyze the shape of the distribution and identify key statistics (mean, median, range)

### 3. Discrete Categorical Attribute in 1-D

For categorical data like quality or wine type:

- Create a bar plot showing the frequency distribution
- Calculate and display the percentage of each category
- For the quality attribute, visualize the distribution and discuss if the dataset is balanced across quality levels

## Analysis Questions

For each visualization you create, answer these questions:

1. What is the overall shape of the distribution? (normal, skewed, bimodal, etc.)
2. Are there any outliers or unexpected values?
3. What are the central tendency measures (mean, median, mode) and what do they tell you?
4. How might the distribution of this attribute affect subsequent analyses?
