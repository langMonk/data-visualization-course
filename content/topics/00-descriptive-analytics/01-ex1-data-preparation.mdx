# Exercise 1: Data Preparation

## Objective
In this exercise, you will set up the wine quality dataset for analysis by loading, transforming, and merging the data.

## Tasks

### Load and merge datasets

1. Read about the dataset structure (explore the metadata in winequality.names)
2. Load the winequality-white.csv and winequality-red.csv into Pandas DataFrames
3. Add `wine_type` as an attribute to each DataFrame (label red wines as 'red' and white wines as 'white')
4. Use the `apply` method and pd.Categorical to encode a new `quality_label` attribute with categorical values:
    - 'low': quality scores in range [0, 5)
    - 'medium': quality scores in range [5, 7)
    - 'high': quality scores in range [7, 10]
5. Merge the red and white wine datasets into a single DataFrame called `wines`
6. Re-shuffle records to randomize data points (use `sample` method with `random_state` for reproducibility)

### Understand dataset features

1. Print the first few rows of the dataset using the `head()` method
2. Generate descriptive statistics for key attributes in both red and white wines using:
```python
subset_attributes = ['residual sugar', 'total sulfur dioxide', 'sulphates', 'alcohol', 'volatile acidity', 'quality']
   ```
3. Compare statistics across different quality levels (low, medium, high) for these attributes:
```python
subset_attributes = ['alcohol', 'volatile acidity', 'pH', 'quality']
   ```

## Notes
- Pay attention to the separator used in the CSV files (hint: it's not a comma)
- When comparing statistics across wine types or quality levels, consider using `pd.concat` with appropriate keys to create a well-structured comparison table
- After completing this exercise, you should have a clean, labeled dataset ready for visualization and analysis in subsequent exercises
