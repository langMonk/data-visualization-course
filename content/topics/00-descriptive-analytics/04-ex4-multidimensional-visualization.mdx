# Exercise 4: Multidimensional Visualization

## Objective
Develop advanced visualization techniques to represent three or more dimensions simultaneously, enabling deeper insights into complex relationships within the wine dataset.

## Background
As datasets grow in complexity, we need methods to visualize multiple dimensions at once. This exercise explores techniques for representing 3+ dimensional data through creative use of visualization elements such as position, color, size, shape, and faceting.

## Tasks

### 1. Three-Dimensional Visualization

#### Three Continuous Variables:
- Create a 3D scatter plot with three continuous variables of your choice (e.g., residual sugar, fixed acidity, and alcohol)
- Experiment with viewing angles to best reveal the data structure
- Discuss any patterns, clusters, or relationships you observe in three-dimensional space

#### Size as a Third Dimension:
- Create a 2D scatter plot where the size of points represents a third variable
- Use residual sugar as the size indicator for points in a plot of two other variables
- Explain the advantages and limitations of using size to represent a dimension

#### Three Categorical Dimensions:
- Use a facet plot (e.g., seaborn's `factorplot` or `catplot`) to visualize the relationship between quality, wine type, and quality label
- Analyze how the different categorical dimensions interact

### 2. Four-Dimensional Visualization

Create visualizations that incorporate four dimensions:

- 3D scatter plot with color as the fourth dimension:
- Create a 3D scatter plot where point colors represent wine type
- Interpret how wine type relates to the three continuous variables

- Bubble chart with size and color:
- Create a scatter plot where both size and color encode different variables
- Use appropriate variables that might reveal interesting patterns (e.g., position: acidity & alcohol; size: residual sugar; color: wine type)

- FacetGrid for faceted visualization:
- Create a FacetGrid with quality label as columns, wine type as hue, and plot two continuous variables
- Repeat with different continuous variables
- Compare how variable relationships differ across facets

### 3. Five and Six-Dimensional Visualization

Push the boundaries of visualization with high-dimensional techniques:

- Create a visualization with five dimensions using:
- x, y, z positions (3D scatter)
- color (wine type)
- size (total sulfur dioxide)
- Interpret what insights can be gained from this complex visualization

- Create a visualization with six dimensions by adding:
- Faceting (by quality or quality label)
- Different marker shapes based on another categorical variable
- Discuss whether the added complexity enhances understanding or creates confusion

## Analysis Questions

For each multidimensional visualization:

1. What patterns become visible in higher dimensions that weren't apparent in simpler views?
2. Which combinations of variables reveal the most interesting relationships?
3. At what point does adding more dimensions make the visualization harder to interpret?
4. How do red and white wines cluster in multidimensional space?
